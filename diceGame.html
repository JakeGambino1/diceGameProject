                    <h3>The Story so far...</h3>
                    <div class="divider"></div>
                    <h4>As the sun rose...</h4>
                    <p>Beta One awoke in his parents' basement. Like every day for the last year, he woke up to find his parents had already gone to work.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        On the counter, he found a note from Mom:
                        <blockquote>
                            Leftovers in the fridge. I know things are tough right now, but it will get better. You just have to GET A FUCKING JOB AND GET OUT OF OUR DAMN HOUSE!
                        </blockquote>
                        Typical, he thought. But something was different about this morning... as he took a bite of his avocado toast, he decided enough is enough! He was going to leave the beta lifestyle. His evolution would be swift and his alpha dominance without question. He took one more bite of avocado toast and gave the rest to his dog.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        And with a weak, timid tug at the door, he was on his way.</p>

                    <h4>Meanwhile across town...</h4>
                    <p>Another Beta, Two, was having a cry. His kitten refused to cuddle with him. It was a tough morning.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        After his girlfriend left their polyamorous relationship two weeks ago, he had been in a downward spiral. As he dried his eyes in a recylced-material handkerchief, he noticed something in his cat's defiant eyes. The cat was the alpha living in the apartment. Beta Two immediately snapped out of his soy-infused slumber, threw on his Beats headphones, turned on Eye of the Tiger and hit the road.
                    </p>
                    <h4>The Clash</h4>
                    <p>Around noon, both betas were approaching Starbucks. They knew this was their first opportunity to assert dominance. They thought "I will display my dominance!" and simultaneously reached for the door.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        As they stared into eachother's souls, they realized neither would relent. The battle was about to begin.
                    </p>
                    <h3>The Rules of the Duel</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Stats are rolled randomly
                            <ol>
                                <li>You can do them individually or do a quick start which automatically rolls stats for both characters</li>
                                <li>Once the players are confirmed, you may reroll a random stat one a time with a new random value</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>Combat
                            <ol>
                                <li>Each attack has a chance to stagger by rolling two die. If both die rolls are on the same side of 3, the player is staggered and loses 1 defense for the remainder of the showdown.</li>
                                <li>Each player has a base health roll of 10. The 20-sided dice roll adds to that number.</li>
                                <li>Minimum damage from a combat round is 1.</li>
                                <li>There is a bonus weapon damage stat, like rock-paper-scissors
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Sword > Hammer</li>
                                        <li>Hammer > Shield</li>
                                        <li>Shield > Sword</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
